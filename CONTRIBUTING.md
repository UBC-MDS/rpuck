This repository is mainly working as a student project for Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia, we are open source projects, and we welcome contributions of all kinds: new lessons, fixes to existing material, bug reports, and reviews of proposed changes are all welcome.

## Contributor Agreement
By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under our [license]( https://github.com/UBC-MDS/pypuck/blob/master/LICENSE). Before contributing to this repository, please discuss the change you intend to make via issue with the owners of this repository. Please kindly refer to the [code of conduct]() when contributing to the project.

## How to Contribute
The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a spelling mistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error. This is a good way to introduce yourself and to meet some of our community members.

1.	You can report problems or suggest improvements by creating an issue. This allows us to assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.
2.	If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to resolve an existing issue that's been labeled by the maintainers or typos/bugs, you can submit a pull request (PR). Instructions for submitting a PR are included below. If you'd like to suggest substantial changes such as removing or adding topics in the lesson, please first raise an issue to allow the maintainers to comment, so we can discuss whether/how these changes should be made.

Issues in this repository are labeled with labels by the maintainers, which you may find useful for navigating open issues.

## What to Contribute
There are many ways to contribute, from writing new exercises and improving existing ones to updating or filling in the documentation and submitting bug reports about things that don't work, aren't clear, or are missing. 

Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are just as welcome: we are smarter together than we are on our own. Reviews from novices and newcomers are particularly valuable: it's easy for people who have been using these lessons for a while to forget how impenetrable some of this material can be, so fresh eyes are always welcome.
